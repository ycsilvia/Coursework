They want to perform an A/B test of this with $n$ customers. As the distribution of revenues is quite skewed, they wish to explicitly compute the power of this test in the event that the test group has the same values of $\\lambda$ and $q$, but $p_1 = 0.975, p_2=0.024, p_3=.001$ (i.e. the probability of getting a significant result if this particular alternative is true). Assume they are doing a one-sided two-sample t-test with level $\\alpha=0.01$. \n",

    "- run_experiment(n, lam, q, p1, p2) which creates the two test groups of size n each, calculates their mean revenue, and performs a two sample t-test on them. It should return a 1 if we reject the null hypothesis that the groups have the same, and 0 if otherwise. Let p1 be the mixing parameters for the control group and p2 be the mixing parameters for experimental group. For the t-test use scipy.stats.ttest_ind, do not assume equal variance between the two groups.\n",
