# Course Description

Simulation is a broad term related to the generalization, modeling, and analysis of real-world processes or systems with the help of statistics theories and computer programming. Simulation is widely applied both academically and managerially. Decision-makers rely on simulation especially when it is costly (or even impossible) to implement and analyze a real-world system.

This course will delve deep into different simulation techniques with a focus on the application in operation research. We will first introduce simulating random variables from different distributions. We will then discuss how to simulate discrete event systems from simple arrival processes to systems with servers. In addition, we will discuss the basics of continuous event systems simulation. We will wrap up the course with some important variance reduction techniques to improve the efficiency of the simulation.

Sometimes students have questions about the applicability of this course - trust me, it is some of the most useful stuff you will learn! In general, Monte Carlo simulations given you the ability to answer any probabilistic or simulation question you want to ask; getting experience designing and building such systems is a huge learning opportunity. Even some of the more theoretical aspects of this course will come up more often than you'd expect over the course of your career.
