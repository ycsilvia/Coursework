    "## A randomized non-homogeneous poisson process\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider the idea of non-homogeneous poisson process (this is a slight abuse of the term) with a randomized intensity function $R(t)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at one such model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- there is a baseline intensity parameter $\\lambda > 0$\n",
    "- when the $i$-th event occurs, we generate a random variable $M_i \\sim \\exp(\\lambda)$ called the event's \"mark\" that determines the instaneous increase in the intensity function. Assume the $M_i$ are independent.\n",
    "- there is a decay parameter, $\\alpha > 0$ that determines how long the impact of an event's mark is felt\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose there have been $N(t)$ events by time $t$, at times $S_1 < ... < S_{N(t)}$ with marks $M_1,...,M_{N(t)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$R(t) = \\lambda + \\sum_{i=1}^{N(t)} M_i \\exp(-\\alpha(t - S_i))$, meaning the intensity at time t, is a function of the number of events, their specific times, and their marks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the algorithm suggested in the hints below, write a function generate_process(lam, mu, alpha, T) that generates the arrival times for one run of such a process until time $T$. The output should be a numpy array. \n",
    "\n",
    "Output $n=10,000$ runs of such a process until $T=1$ for the parameters $\\lambda=2$, $\\mu=1$, $\\alpha=0.5$. This should be a list (of length n) of numpy arrays (of varying lengths). Calculate N(1) for each run and output that as well. This should be a numpy array of length n.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hints: \n",
    "(1) What is the distribution of the first arrival time?\n",
    "(2) at $t>0$, if we know the previous arrival times and their marks, how can we use the interarrival method coupled with the thinning method to sample from this process?"

    "A wrestling tournament has 10 weight classes (we'll design them A, B, C,...,J), each with a sixteen competitor bracket - the tournament is single elimination, with four rounds. For each weight class: 8 matches in the first round, 4 matches in the second round, 2 matches in the third (semi-final) round, and 1 match in the fourth (final) round.\n",

    "There are four mats (we'll call them mats 0, 1, 2, 3). For the purposes of giving competitors time to get ready, each mat has a queue (in terms of match numbers) of length 3 (in addition to the competitors on the mat). Once a match is completed, the first match in the queue for that particular mat goes into \"service\", while the other two matches in the queue for that mat move up, and the next match numerically that is not currently in a queue for a mat will enter the queue for that mat.\n",
