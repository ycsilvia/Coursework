    "## A randomized non-homogeneous poisson process\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider the idea of non-homogeneous poisson process (this is a slight abuse of the term) with a randomized intensity function $R(t)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at one such model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- there is a baseline intensity parameter $\\lambda > 0$\n",
    "- when the $i$-th event occurs, we generate a random variable $M_i \\sim \\exp(\\lambda)$ called the event's \"mark\" that determines the instaneous increase in the intensity function. Assume the $M_i$ are independent.\n",
    "- there is a decay parameter, $\\alpha > 0$ that determines how long the impact of an event's mark is felt\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose there have been $N(t)$ events by time $t$, at times $S_1 < ... < S_{N(t)}$ with marks $M_1,...,M_{N(t)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$R(t) = \\lambda + \\sum_{i=1}^{N(t)} M_i \\exp(-\\alpha(t - S_i))$, meaning the intensity at time t, is a function of the number of events, their specific times, and their marks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the algorithm suggested in the hints below, write a function generate_process(lam, mu, alpha, T) that generates the arrival times for one run of such a process until time $T$. The output should be a numpy array. \n",
    "\n",
    "Output $n=10,000$ runs of such a process until $T=1$ for the parameters $\\lambda=2$, $\\mu=1$, $\\alpha=0.5$. This should be a list (of length n) of numpy arrays (of varying lengths). Calculate N(1) for each run and output that as well. This should be a numpy array of length n.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hints: \n",
    "(1) What is the distribution of the first arrival time?\n",
    "(2) at $t>0$, if we know the previous arrival times and their marks, how can we use the interarrival method coupled with the thinning method to sample from this process?"
