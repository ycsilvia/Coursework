# Music Recommendation System

Machine learning algorithms have been used a lot to understand what makes a song popular and how to promote it effectively.
The dataset used in this project is one found on Kaggle with  Spotify tracks over a range of 125 different genres, and each track has some audio features associated with it. There are in total 20 columns in this dataset: except for the common ones like artist, track name, album name, there are also more professional and music-related columns like energy, acousticness, danceability, tempo, and likeness. Based on that, I made a recommendation system that could return a playlist of 10 songs with the greatest cosine similarity with the specific track input.
